# Legal Considerations: AI Training vs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

| **Legal Aspect**            | **Training AI Models**                                      | **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Copyright Compliance**    | Riskierâ€”embedding copyrighted data into models              | Lower riskâ€”referencing instead of storing |
| **Terms of Service**        | Can violate TOS if scraping restricted sites               | Still must follow TOS when accessing data |
| **Personal Data (GDPR, CCPA)** | Must ensure compliance with privacy laws                   | Referencing does not store personal data directly |
| **Database Rights (EU law)** | Scraping structured data can trigger legal issues          | Less riskâ€”using external databases via queries |
| **Fair Use Argument**       | Legally uncertainâ€”courts are debating this                 | Slightly stronger case if properly cited |
| **Attribution & Transparency** | Not always possible in training                           | Easierâ€”can cite sources directly |
| **Use of APIs**             | Recommended to avoid scraping issues                      | Preferred method for legal compliance |
| **Licensing Considerations** | Must respect dataset licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL)          | Easier to filter datasets before referencing |

## Key Takeaways
- **To stay legally compliant**, focus on **open-access datasets**, properly **citing sources**, and using **official APIs** whenever possible.
- **RAG reduces risk**, but terms of service and database rights should still be respected.
- **AI training on copyrighted data can be legally complex**, so filtering and license tracking is essential.
